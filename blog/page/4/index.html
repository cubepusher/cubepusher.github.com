  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my personal favorite game bloggers,
<a href="http://hiewandboardgames.blogspot.com/">Hiew</a>, recently wrote up a
couple of
<a href="http://hiewandboardgames.blogspot.com/2010/08/race-for-galaxy-brink-of-war.html">nice</a><a href="http://hiewandboardgames.blogspot.com/2010/07/good-ai-bad-ai.html">pieces</a>
that feature Keldon’s <a href="http://www.keldon.net/rftg/">AI software for Race for the Galaxy</a>.</p>

<p>Playing against the <em>Race</em> AI is a challenging and satisfying endeavor. At
first, I won less than 20% of my 2-player games, but now that I’ve had
some practice, I’m hovering around <del>60</del>40% (the <em>Brink of War</em>
expansion just came out, and I’m getting familiar with the strategy
still). Like Hiew, even though I have well over 100 games under my belt
by this point, I feel like a very mediocre player. What’s more, I still
learn something new about <em>Race</em> every time I play.</p>

<p>That, friends, is <strong>depth</strong>. It’s a testament not only to the quality of
the game itself, but also to that of Keldon’s AI software. I downloaded
the source to have a look under the hood, and though I’m hardly a Tcl
developer, the code appears to be very soundly designed and well
thought-out. Granted, it lacks the polished user interaction of a
commercial app, but for a free download, I’m impressed.</p>

<p>What’s more, Keldon recently updated the app to include the most recent
expansion, <em>Brink of War</em>, and this new version includes networked
multiplayer (read: human vs. human) support. I have not played against
many human players yet, but look forward to doing so.</p>

<p>In the same spirit as Hiew’s posts on the subject, below are a few
screenshots and descriptions of the results of some recent games of RFTG
I’ve played using Keldon’s platform. Obviously, you’ll need to have
played <em>Race</em> a few times to appreciate any of this, but perhaps it will
make some curious enough to check the game out.</p>

<p>All three games were 3-player games, me vs. two AI players, with all
three expansions in play and takeovers active.</p>

<h3>Game 1: Uplift Smackdown</h3>

<p><a href="http://2dr.se/JwoU/http://2dr.se/JwoU/uplift_smackdown.jpg"><img src="http://2dr.se/Jx6l/uplift_smackdown_sm.jpg" title="Uplift Smackdown" alt="Screenshot - Uplift Smackdown" /></a></p>

<p>In the first game, I began with <strong>Doomed World</strong>, which I discarded for a
turn-3 <strong>Armaments World</strong>. I actually laid down a 6-cost development,
<strong>Pan-Galactic Research</strong>, on turn 2, which is very unusual for me, but it
paid off big. I had <strong>Uplift Code</strong> in my hand early, and I started slapping
down Uplift worlds like crazy. I also was able to achieve some kind of
crazy Imperium synergy with both <strong>Imperium Seat</strong> and <strong>Imperium Lords</strong>,
topping off my tableau with the 7-cost <strong>Rebel Homeworld</strong> and the 9-cost
<strong>Alien Departure Point</strong>.</p>

<p>My opponent to the left, Red, started off with <strong>Rebel Cantina</strong>, but didn’t
really do anything with it, switching gears to more of an Alien scoring
strategy that featured <strong>Alien Cornucopia</strong>. Green, on the right, initially
began with the militaristic <strong>New Sparta</strong>, but like his counterpart, never
fully took advantage of it.</p>

<p>The final scores were 82-61-49, with me winning the day and Red bringing
up the rear. 82 is about as high as I can remember ever scoring, but
it’s certainly not high compared to scores I’ve seen posted by others.</p>

<h3>Game 2: Brown World Rush</h3>

<p><a href="http://2dr.se/JwkQ/brown_world_rush.jpg"><img src="http://2dr.se/Jy5m/brown_world_rush_sm.jpg" title="Brown World Rush" alt="Screenshot - Brown World Rush" /></a></p>

<p>The second game was very different from the first. I took full advantage
of the special ability of my start world, <strong>Galactic Scavengers</strong>, which
allowed me to stash one card from every purchase I made, and recover
them on every produce phase. This can be very powerful when used
properly. It basically equates to a 1-card “manufacturer’s rebate” on
everything you buy.</p>

<p>My starting hand also contained both <strong>Alpha Centauri</strong> and <strong>Gem Smugglers</strong>,
two brown worlds that gave discounts on brown worlds, so it was pretty
clear what direction I had to take. An early <strong>Improved Logistics</strong> helped
me rush to fill out my tableau with a bunch of other brown and blue
worlds before either of the other players got their engines fully
started. I didn’t even bother playing a 6-cost dev because it would have
slowed me down too much. I did have to prestige-consume in the final
turn, however, because Green was coming on strong.</p>

<p>Final scores were 33-30-18, again in my favor. Red had a terrible
showing, but he actually took over one of my military worlds at the end,
almost as if he were trying to play kingmaker. Green nearly stole the
game with <strong>Terraforming Guild</strong> and his 3 windfall worlds.</p>

<h3>Game 3: Mining League</h3>

<p><a href="http://2dr.se/Jwuy/mining_league.jpg"><img src="http://2dr.se/JxZc/mining_league_sm.jpg" title="Mining League" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>Initially, I went after a Rebel strategy, but when the cards weren’t
there, I committed to the <strong>Mining League</strong>. I was able to get 3 quality
brown production worlds and <strong>Mining Robots</strong> played, but Red put together a
very nice consume-based strategy from the very start, and eventually
blew by me with a pile of victory point chips before I got close to
hitting 12 cards in my tableau. I think Green might have helped Red out
a little too much, because he kept producing in order to get prestige.
Oh well.</p>

<p>This score was 53-44-25, with Red winning, me in second, and Green last.
The game ended due to VP chips running out, with Red claiming 33 of
them. I shake my fist at you, Red.</p>

<h3>Check out Keldon’s AI for RFTG</h3>

<p>Whether your computing platform of choice is PC, Mac, or Linux, if you
want to learn <em>Race for the Galaxy</em> or improve your gameplay, look no
further than Keldon’s excellent AI. It’s superb, it’s cross-platform,
it’s a <a href="http://www.keldon.net/rftg/">free download</a>, and the
<a href="http://riograndegames.com/uploads/Game/Game_240_gameRules.pdf">rules</a>
of <em>Race for the Galaxy</em>
(<a href="http://riograndegames.com/uploads/Game/Game_253_gameRules.pdf">and</a>
<a href="http://riograndegames.com/uploads/Game/Game_301_gameRules.pdf">its</a>
<a href="http://riograndegames.com/uploads/Game/Game_357_gameRules.pdf">expansions</a>)
are freely available from Rio Grande Games.</p>

<p>For the legally astute, Rio Grande Games, the publisher of <em>Race for the
Galaxy</em>, has given Keldon permission to use actual card images and names in the
app, so it’s all above board. Play away.</p>
