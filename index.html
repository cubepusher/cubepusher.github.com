  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63888/innovation">Innovation</a>
(2010) is a card game by Carl Chudyk, published by Asmadi Games (not to be
confused with Asmodee).</p>

<p><img src="http://2dr.se/JxK5/innovation_300.jpeg" alt="Innovation" /></p>

<p>You might recognize the name of the designer if you are familiar with <em>Glory to
Rome</em>, the game for which Chudyk may be best known. Like GtR, <em>Innovation</em> is
a card game with some very interesting and original mechanics. It is themed
around civilization, which is pretty much a guaranteed buy for me. I have no
self-restraint when it comes to civ-themed games; I want to try ‘em all!</p>

<p>In practice, <em>Innovation</em> turns out to be more of an interactive tech tree
than a typical civilization game. However, to quote Kip Dynamite, “I
love technology…”</p>

<h2>The Components</h2>

<p>Each of the 110 cards in <em>Innovation</em> is unique. Cards represent
technological advancements that characterized human history as we know
it. The game begins with techs like <strong>The Wheel</strong> and <strong>Agriculture</strong>,
and in the most modern era, includes techs like <strong>Databases</strong> and <strong>The
Internet</strong>. The cards are separated into piles, one for each “Age” of
history (Ancient all the way up through the Digital Age). What’s more, 1
card from each Age is selected face-down and set aside as an Achievement
to be earned with points, forming a sort of “kitty” in the middle of the
table so the overall pool of cards in play cannot be known at the
outset. There are also 5 “special” Achievement cards that can be earned
by satisfying specific conditions, like having so many of a particular
symbol, or having all top cards of a certain level in play.</p>

<p>That’s it. Just a big deck of cards, some player mats, and a lot of
’splaining to do…</p>

<h2>The Goal</h2>

<p>Players’ general objective in <em>Innovation</em> is to obtain Achievements by
various means. Picking up a certain number of Achievements is the
primary victory condition of the game. Certain cards in later Ages have
alternate winning conditions as well. The game also has a built-in
“clock” as a winning condition, in that, if a player attempts to draw a
card from Age 10 (the highest pile) and there are no cards left, the
player with the highest score (not Achievements) wins. The alternate
winning conditions add a tension to the game that I rather enjoy…
multiple paths to victory and all that.</p>

<h2>The Gameplay</h2>

<p>In play, cards come in 5 different colors, and each contains text
describing particular effects listed on it along with an associated
symbol, as well as 3 large symbols that add to the strength of a
player’s tableau in those areas. These symbols, and the strategy behind
stacking, are what makes the card actions so interesting. When a player
plays a card of the same color as a card already in your play area, the
first card must be covered by the newly played card, creating a stack,
and thus concealing the pre-existing card. This is important, because in
Innovation, when it comes to symbol counts and executing card actions,
only the top-most cards count. However, there are ways to “splay”
(spread) stacks of cards in various directions, which exposes 1-3
symbols on cards in the stack underneath the top card.</p>

<p>On a player’s turn, he can take two actions, in any order: <strong>draw</strong> a
card from an Age pile into his hand, <strong>meld</strong> (play) a card from his
hand to his board, <strong>achieve</strong> (take an achievement if the requirements
are met), or take a <strong>dogma</strong> action allowed by a top card in his board.
A player can achieve twice, achieve and draw, draw twice, draw and meld,
etc.</p>

<p>That’s as far as I will go with covering rules specifics. Let me just say that
while the rules are extremely straightforward, the cards are less so. However,
in contrast to a game like <em>Race for the Galaxy</em> (one of my all-time
favorites), there is no encyclopedia worth of iconography to learn – every card
does exactly what it says, and the game uses a vocabulary that is very easy to
get familiar with.</p>

<h2>The Reckoning</h2>

<p>At the core of <em>Innovation</em> is the variety of special powers made
available to a player by each card’s dogma actions. Dogma actions can
break the rules in some pretty crazy ways, and yes, the potential for
constructing card combos is pretty huge. For example, using the Paper
technology with the <strong>Perspective</strong> technology is a combination that can
create a formidable scoring engine. Believe me, there are far more, and
many that I haven’t discovered yet.</p>

<p><em>Innovation</em> is an almost purely tactical game. As it is a card game, luck
of the draw is a major component, and there isn’t much getting around
the very real possibility of a player top-decking his way to victory.
The nature of the cards make wild swings of fate fairly prevalent, which
is a double-edged sword: on one hand, a player can slap down a killer
combo that lifts his civilization up out of the ashes, or even win the
game outright. On the other hand, a player will sometimes be able to
build up such a head of steam that he ends up being unstoppable, and
rolls effortlessly for the win.</p>

<p>For some, this kind of chaos can be somewhat off-putting. It’s true that
with a full complement of 4 players, <em>Innovation</em> can be very chaotic
indeed.</p>

<p>For fans of other medium- to high-complexity strategy card games such as
<em>Magic: The Gathering</em> or <em>Race for the Galaxy</em>, <em>Innovation</em> should be a big
draw. It is very different from most other games of its kind, which
makes it worthy of adding to most any game collection.</p>

<p>To date, I’ve played <em>Innovation</em> over a dozen times, and each play has
been completely different and interesting in its own way. As you can see
in my <a href="/blog/2010-retrospective">2010 Retrospective</a>, I am a fan of it.
<em>Innovation</em> also won a Golden Geek for
<a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BoardGameGeek_Golden_Geek">Best Card Game</a>
in 2010.</p>
