In a short time, the card game
[Dominion](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion) (2008) by
Donald X. Vaccarino has become immediately popular and spurred several
expansions. With its concise rules, it offers quick, addictive play in a
format that is easily teachable. Strangely, it takes the most boring
mechanic of collectible card games (i.e., building your deck) and turns
that into the core mechanic of the game. Yet in refining the rules, it
has made an unique, expandable, and portable game that deserves its
accolades as a “filler” type of game that doesn’t feel shallow at all.

### Components & Setup

*Dominion* is played entirely with cards: there is no board, tokens,
scoresheet, or player mats. Instead, there are 25 action cards (of 10
each) plus three denominations of money and three types of victory
cards. Setup is wonderfully simple. It takes a few minutes and is as
simple as choosing ten cards out of the 25 action cards in the box and
putting those stacks in the center of the table along with three
standard stacks of money cards and three stacks of victory cards.
Everyone gets the same starting deck of three victory points and seven
money cards. It couldn’t be simpler.

### Gameplay

Each player deals five cards off the top of their deck and reveals them
to everyone. From that hand, game play can be summed by a clever ABC
acronym. Gamers have one Action: they can use a action card. They have
one Buy, which means they can use the money in that hand to buy an item
in the center of the table (a victory point, action card, or money).
They must then Clean up, which means to discard their hand into their
discard pile. The next player starts the same process. When you run out
of cards in your deck, shuffle them and repeat.

When any three stacks of cards in the center of the table are gone (or
if the 6 point victory card stack is gone), the game is over. Players
sift their stack and count all of the victory points in it. The player
with the highest total of victory points wins.

It sounds too simple, but I didn’t mention that the action cards are
incredibly clever and varied. Some cards let you attack other players,
give you extra money, lets you trash dead cards in your own deck, give
you bonuses in the end of the game, or steal cards from other players.
There are also cards that have an additional action on them, so if you
activate them with your action, you then have an additional action to
use (and if that 2nd card has an action, you can chain these action to
have 3, 4, or maybe even 5 actions). Therefore, your one hand can become
a chain reaction setting yourself ahead of everyone else.

The end goal is to refine their deck so it has the most victory points
but so it also has enough money and actions so you can buy items and
change your outcome. It’s a tricky balance, since you need a deck with
higher victory points than everyone else, but a deck clogged with
victory point cards means that your actions are limited each turn.
Therefore, many players try to trash lower cards and upgrade to higher
cards or fill their deck with a variety. Alternate strategies are to buy
action cards that attack other players or give them curses that deduct
from their victory points. But you’ll find yourself refining your deck
constantly during the game to find that right balance in a game that has
a good amount of skill and luck to keep game play sharp and quick.

### What’s Good About It?

There are many things that make this a worthwhile addition to your
collection. For one, it works well as a gateway game. *Dominion* is a
quicker cousin to other strategy cards games like *Race for the Galaxy*
and *Magic: The Gathering*, but *Dominion*’s appeal and strategies are more
immediate. It’s a wonderful, portable game that feels meatier than most
fillers and is excellent to teach to new players or to put on the table
while you wait for your game group to arrive.

*Dominion* also works well as a couples game. If I ask my wife what game
she dislikes, it is usually a game that has a “take that” element or a
game where combat is necessary. Whether or not she will agree to play
depends on how much of that is in a game. *Lost Cities* or *Agricola* are a
yes, but *Battleline* or *Magic: The Gathering* are a no. The beauty of
*Dominion* is that you can tweak the deck so it has more or less
interaction. With 25 different cards at your command (and many more with
expansions) you can make it more combative (e.g., add thieves or witches
that can attack other players) or simply a competitive solitaire game
(e.g., take the attack cards out, and players are just competing for the
highest score).

### Concluding Thoughts

*Dominion* is quick (20-30 minutes), replayable, portable, configurable,
tactical, and unique. It plays well with any number of players (2-4 out
of the box, but expandable to 8); few games scale so perfectly without
adding downtime. The multiple expansions for *Dominion* add new flavor to
games and keep it fresh and surprising, but even the base game offers
tons of replayability and variety for hundreds of plays.

### Where Can I Buy Dominion?

*Dominion* won a **ton** of gaming awards in 2009, including the prestigious
Spiel des Jahres, the Deutcher Spiele Preis, and the BGG Golden Geek.
This is a really big deal, and as a result of the critical exposure,
it’s hard *not* to find a copy of Dominion even if you are just looking
for it in passing. It’s on Amazon, I’ve seen it on shelves at Target and
Barnes & Noble, and, of course,

The success of *Dominion* has also made possible several expansions, which
are also widely available.
