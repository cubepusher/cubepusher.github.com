One of my personal favorite game bloggers,
[Hiew](http://hiewandboardgames.blogspot.com/), recently wrote up a
couple of
[nice](http://hiewandboardgames.blogspot.com/2010/08/race-for-galaxy-brink-of-war.html)[pieces](http://hiewandboardgames.blogspot.com/2010/07/good-ai-bad-ai.html)
that feature Keldon’s [AI software for Race for the Galaxy](http://www.keldon.net/rftg/).

Playing against the *Race* AI is a challenging and satisfying endeavor. At
first, I won less than 20% of my 2-player games, but now that I’ve had
some practice, I’m hovering around <del>60</del>40% (the *Brink of War*
expansion just came out, and I’m getting familiar with the strategy
still). Like Hiew, even though I have well over 100 games under my belt
by this point, I feel like a very mediocre player. What’s more, I still
learn something new about *Race* every time I play.

That, friends, is **depth**. It’s a testament not only to the quality of
the game itself, but also to that of Keldon’s AI software. I downloaded
the source to have a look under the hood, and though I’m hardly a Tcl
developer, the code appears to be very soundly designed and well
thought-out. Granted, it lacks the polished user interaction of a
commercial app, but for a free download, I’m impressed.

What’s more, Keldon recently updated the app to include the most recent
expansion, *Brink of War*, and this new version includes networked
multiplayer (read: human vs. human) support. I have not played against
many human players yet, but look forward to doing so.

In the same spirit as Hiew’s posts on the subject, below are a few
screenshots and descriptions of the results of some recent games of RFTG
I’ve played using Keldon’s platform. Obviously, you’ll need to have
played *Race* a few times to appreciate any of this, but perhaps it will
make some curious enough to check the game out.

All three games were 3-player games, me vs. two AI players, with all
three expansions in play and takeovers active.

### Game 1: Uplift Smackdown

[![Screenshot - Uplift Smackdown](http://2dr.se/Jx6l/uplift_smackdown_sm.jpg "Uplift Smackdown")](http://2dr.se/JwoU/http://2dr.se/JwoU/uplift_smackdown.jpg)

In the first game, I began with **Doomed World**, which I discarded for a
turn-3 **Armaments World**. I actually laid down a 6-cost development,
**Pan-Galactic Research**, on turn 2, which is very unusual for me, but it
paid off big. I had **Uplift Code** in my hand early, and I started slapping
down Uplift worlds like crazy. I also was able to achieve some kind of
crazy Imperium synergy with both **Imperium Seat** and **Imperium Lords**,
topping off my tableau with the 7-cost **Rebel Homeworld** and the 9-cost
**Alien Departure Point**.

My opponent to the left, Red, started off with **Rebel Cantina**, but didn’t
really do anything with it, switching gears to more of an Alien scoring
strategy that featured **Alien Cornucopia**. Green, on the right, initially
began with the militaristic **New Sparta**, but like his counterpart, never
fully took advantage of it.

The final scores were 82-61-49, with me winning the day and Red bringing
up the rear. 82 is about as high as I can remember ever scoring, but
it’s certainly not high compared to scores I’ve seen posted by others.

### Game 2: Brown World Rush

[![Screenshot - Brown World Rush](http://2dr.se/Jy5m/brown_world_rush_sm.jpg "Brown World Rush")](http://2dr.se/JwkQ/brown_world_rush.jpg)

The second game was very different from the first. I took full advantage
of the special ability of my start world, **Galactic Scavengers**, which
allowed me to stash one card from every purchase I made, and recover
them on every produce phase. This can be very powerful when used
properly. It basically equates to a 1-card “manufacturer’s rebate” on
everything you buy.

My starting hand also contained both **Alpha Centauri** and **Gem Smugglers**,
two brown worlds that gave discounts on brown worlds, so it was pretty
clear what direction I had to take. An early **Improved Logistics** helped
me rush to fill out my tableau with a bunch of other brown and blue
worlds before either of the other players got their engines fully
started. I didn’t even bother playing a 6-cost dev because it would have
slowed me down too much. I did have to prestige-consume in the final
turn, however, because Green was coming on strong.

Final scores were 33-30-18, again in my favor. Red had a terrible
showing, but he actually took over one of my military worlds at the end,
almost as if he were trying to play kingmaker. Green nearly stole the
game with **Terraforming Guild** and his 3 windfall worlds.

### Game 3: Mining League

[![image](http://2dr.se/JxZc/mining_league_sm.jpg "Mining League")](http://2dr.se/Jwuy/mining_league.jpg)

Initially, I went after a Rebel strategy, but when the cards weren’t
there, I committed to the **Mining League**. I was able to get 3 quality
brown production worlds and **Mining Robots** played, but Red put together a
very nice consume-based strategy from the very start, and eventually
blew by me with a pile of victory point chips before I got close to
hitting 12 cards in my tableau. I think Green might have helped Red out
a little too much, because he kept producing in order to get prestige.
Oh well.

This score was 53-44-25, with Red winning, me in second, and Green last.
The game ended due to VP chips running out, with Red claiming 33 of
them. I shake my fist at you, Red.
