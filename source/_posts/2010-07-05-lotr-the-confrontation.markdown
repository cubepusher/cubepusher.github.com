Never underestimate Dr. Knizia. His games usually seems laughably simple on
paper, but often have a sly mechanic or clever end-game scoring that make them
enjoyable brain-burners. Consider
[Ingenious](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9674/ingenious), which would be
a ordinary abstract game in the hands of a lesser designer. However, the
scoring in that game is based on your lowest color peg instead of the highest
(or cumulative) score. That one twist turns the game on its head where you
constantly fine-tune your moves to advance your pegs.

That brings me to the under-appreciated
[Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18833/lord-of-the-rings-the-confrontation-deluxe-edition)
(2002). I think this is a real gem of a 2-player game that may be overlooked by
players seeking meatier “War of the Ring” games who might dismiss this merely
as [Stratego](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1917/stratego) with a pasted
Tolkien theme. But there’s more than meets the eye here.

Gameplay
--------

The mechanics are so simple that young players and gateway gamers will be able
to pick it up easily. Each player chooses either the Fellowship side or the
Sauron side of a board depicting Middle Earth. The Fellowship has 9 game pieces
on a small board, and need to get one piece (Frodo) to Mordor, which is on the
opposite side. Sauron has 9 different pieces, and needs to defeat Frodo or get
three enemies to the Shire, which is on his opposite side. Each character piece
has a different ability, and is assigned a strength number from 0 to 9.

The actual identity of the pieces are hidden from the other player (that’s the
Stratego element), so neither player knows if they are attacking a powerful
minion or a small whelp of a character. Moreover, multiple characters can
occupy non-mountain places on the board and swap pieces. So a clever player can
constantly play a shell-game of hiding their valuable pieces so their enemy
never knows which is which. It makes this into a great bluffing games, instead
of the open battleground of *Chess*, where every piece is known and every piece’s
ability can be spotted at a glance.

Players also have a set of nine battle cards that range from attack modifiers
(e.g., adding +2 to your strength) to special abilities (e.g., retreat
backwards). Each player gets one movement, then (if a battle results) they
resolve the battle with the character ability. If that doesn’t solve the
battle, then the numbered strength is used and added to the simultaneously
revealed battle cards. The battle is resolved and it is the next player’s turn.
It’s not a difficult game at first glance.

Why it is So Good
-----------------

Not many 20-30 minute games have this much tension, are this easy to learn, yet
have an enjoyable theme. On the surface, it is *Stratego* with a LOTR theme. But
then there are these wonderful Knizia innovations. For one, the board is
diamond shaped, so the movement spreads outward from your starting position,
then funnels inward to the tight enemy territory. Secondly, there are the
mountains in the center where your abilities are hampered.

This would not be much of a challenge in *Chess*, but in this game characters
must always move forward (with few exceptions). They are mostly pawn-like and
cannot move backwards or sideways. So the diamond-shaped board requires that
you think several moves ahead before moving. You can “dodge” other pieces by
moving to the extreme right or left in this respect because of the ingenious
shape of the board.

The abilities also fit the characters nicely. So the Witch King can attack
sideways, since he is a flying character, while all the other characters can
only attack from the front. Borimir can act like a “bomb” and auto-eliminate
both the attacker and himself. There’s lots of richness in these abilities that
fits the theme and storytelling.

Deeper than it Seems
--------------------

I thought the game would be too easy. But like many of Knizia’s games, the end
game is brain-burning fun. Like Battle Line, by the end of the game you are
forced to make a game-changing decision from only 1-3 possible moves. Having
the mechanic where most characters can only move forward means that you weigh
each decision carefully and decide in advance which characters you can afford
to sacrifice and which must be held by the end game. However, you also need
scout characters to probe the enemy. One misstep and you’ve given your enemy
the ability to win with no possible defense.

The good and evil sides are also balanced in unexpected ways. Sauron’s forces
are much stronger, but the Fellowship’s forces have many retreat capabilities
and are often very slippery. In addition, the board benefits the Fellowship by
giving them a sideways move and a shortcut through the mountains that Sauron’s
forces cannot use.

The hidden nature of the characters also means that the character’s identity is
often not known by the attacker until after they attack. So that (plus the
battle cards) adds a nice bluffing/tactical element to the game that adds much
more tactical fun to the game.

Concluding Thoughts
-------------------

I happily add *Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation* to the short list of great
2-player quick games (a short list including
[Hive](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2655/hive),
[Battle Line](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/760/battle-line), and
[Race for the Galaxy](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-for-the-galaxy)).
Like those other games, it’s a tough act to follow — the game has to be quick,
it has to be tactical, yet it can’t be as paralyzing as a tough game of Chess.

The Tolkien theme works beautifully and is probably the most thematic of
Knizia’s games. You feel the desperation of Frodo when playing the Fellowship
and using the mountains, retreats, and subtle bluffing to slip into Mordor
while you feel the vice-like grip of Sauron with his pieces. The Sauron side
likewise feels powerful but a bit clueless as to which character is Frodo and
how to prevent him from landing in Mordor. Sauron uses his higher-strength
characters to remove as many pieces on the board, while the Fellowship has
a nice variety of evasive tactics that make them escape Sauron’s net easily.

Knizia may be accused of pasted themes and regurgitating old games. But
I challenge any designer to come up with a more enjoyable, streamlined,
inexpensive, 2-player, 30-minute game than *Lord of the Rings: The
Confrontation*. It’s just one of those quick and precise games where you
wouldn’t want to change a single rule in fear that the elegant rules would
collapse.
